## About
**Learning C** is a personal project for me to learn about the C Programming
Language and share it with the world.

## Contents
This project addresses the following contents:
 - The language data types and its representation;
 - Data and function pointers;
 - Data arrays, including multidimensional arrays;
 - Arrays and pointers relations;
 - Data structures with `struct`;
 - Type definitions with `typedef`.

This is a ongoing project, the list of contents will continue to grow.


## Roadmap
The next steps are:
 - Enumerations;
 - Data structures with `union`;
 - Dynamically storage management with `malloc`, `calloc` and `free`;
 - Bit fields and bitwise operations;
 - Variable-length argument lists;
 - File access and I/O;
